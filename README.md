# Interactive SVM Classifier Explorer

## Overview

The **Interactive SVM Classifier Explorer** is a Python-based web application built using Streamlit that empowers users to explore datasets, train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers, and gain insights into the impact of hyperparameters.

This interactive tool offers the following features:

- **Dataset Selection**: Choose from three popular datasets: Iris, Breast Cancer, and Wine, to experiment with SVM classification.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust the 'C' parameter using an interactive slider to observe its effects on SVM classification performance.

- **Data Insights**: Gain a deeper understanding of the dataset with information on shape and class distribution.

- **Data Visualization**: Visualize the loaded dataset in an interactive 3D plot, powered by Plotly, to explore data distribution and SVM classification.

- **Model Evaluation**: Train SVM classifiers, evaluate their accuracy, and view the results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Python libraries used:

- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly (for 3D visualization)

## Usage

- **Select a Dataset**: Pick a dataset (Iris, Breast Cancer, or Wine) from the sidebar to begin exploring.

- **Adjust 'C' Parameter**: Use the 'C' parameter slider to control the regularization of the SVM classifier.

- **Explore the Data**: Click the "Explore" button to visualize the dataset and train the SVM model. Observe the 3D PCA visualization and classification results.

- **View Dataset Information**: Check the dataset's shape and class distribution by clicking the "View Dataset" button.
